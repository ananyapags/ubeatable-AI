Tic-Tac-Toe AI utilizing A\* and or OOP

This project showcased my journey to build unbeatable Artificial Intelligence. I wanted to create not only a resilient AI but one with the lowest time complexity.

This project was a great way to develop my knowledge of Game Theory on a smaller scale. It helped me appreciate the power of organized Object Oriented Programming while trying to apply various algorithms.

I would say the most exciting part of this project was learning that there is always a better, faster way to run my program. It challenged me to think in ways that I had never before. My original plan was to use if-else statements to guide the program's next moves. With further research, I learned about the importance of having a model for your game, which led me to build a game tree for my scenario. With this, I was able to apply Breadth First Search to traverse through the tree in order to find the most efficient way for AI to win. I then challenge myself to look for even more complex algorithms, such as the MiniMax algorithm, and apply them to my program.
